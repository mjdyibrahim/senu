# Synthetic Data Generation

## Overview

This folder contains all the resources, scripts, and generated datasets related to the creation of synthetic data for the Senu project. The synthetic data is used for training and evaluating models optimized for edge devices as part of the Hackathon challenge.

## Folder Structure

- **`prompts/`**: Contains prompt templates and example prompts used to generate synthetic data using Llama 3.1.
- **`generated_datasets/`**: Contains synthetic datasets generated by Llama 3.1, organized by date and data type.
- **`scripts/`**: Contains Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks used for generating synthetic data.
- **`logs/`** (optional): Contains logs and metadata related to the data generation process, including information on prompt usage and data quality checks.

## Usage

### Generating Synthetic Data

To generate synthetic data using Llama 3.1, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Prompts**: Customize or use the example prompts provided in the `prompts/` folder.
2. **Run the Scripts**: Use the Python scripts in the `scripts/` folder to generate the data.
   - Example: `python scripts/generate_synthetic_data.py`
3. **Review and Clean**: The generated data will be saved in the `generated_datasets/` folder. Review and clean the data as needed.
   - Use the data cleaning scripts or manual inspection to ensure high quality.

### Dataset Structure

The synthetic datasets generated follow the same structure as defined in the `StartupData.py` and `startup-questions.json` files. Each dataset includes sections like `Info`, `Team`, `Fundraising`, `Market`, `Business Model`, `Product`, and `Traction`.

### Integration with Main Project

Once the synthetic data is generated and validated, it can be integrated with the main project for training and evaluating models. The data should be linked with the scripts and models in the parent directories for further processing.
